 * ----- FUNCTIONALITY STRETCH GOALS
 * NOTE Users can set their name
 * NOTE Users can filter posts or comments
 * NOTE Set up a call in the API to only get the AMOUNT of comments to a post; we don't want to be taking in ALL that comment data just to filter through and find how many comments are on the post. That's a lot of data.
